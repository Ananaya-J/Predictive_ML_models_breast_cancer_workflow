CLINICAL APPLICATIONS:

1. MOLECULAR SUBTYPING:
   • Luminal A/B classification for hormone receptor positive tumors
   • HER2+ identification for targeted therapy selection
   • Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) characterization
   • Intrinsic subtype determination (PAM50-like classification)

2. TREATMENT SELECTION SUPPORT:
   • Hormone therapy candidates (ESR1, PGR expression)
   • Anti-HER2 therapy eligibility (ERBB2 status)
   • Chemotherapy benefit prediction (proliferation markers)
   • Immunotherapy potential (immune signature analysis)

3. PROGNOSIS AND RISK STRATIFICATION:
   • Recurrence risk assessment
   • Metastatic potential evaluation
   • Overall survival prediction
   • Treatment resistance likelihood

4. PRECISION ONCOLOGY APPLICATIONS:
   • Companion diagnostic development
   • Clinical trial stratification
   • Biomarker-guided therapy selection
   • Treatment monitoring and response prediction

CLINICAL WORKFLOW INTEGRATION:

Phase 1 - Diagnosis:
   • Tissue sample processing for RNA extraction
   • Gene expression profiling using validated assay
   • AI model prediction generation

Phase 2 - Interpretation:
   • Molecular subtype classification
   • Risk score calculation
   • Biomarker profile analysis

Phase 3 - Treatment Planning:
   • Integration with clinical parameters
   • Multidisciplinary team review
   • Personalized treatment recommendation

Phase 4 - Monitoring:
   • Response assessment
   • Resistance monitoring
   • Treatment modification guidance

LIMITATIONS AND CONSIDERATIONS:

• Dataset Specificity: Model trained on specific population cohort
• Validation Status: Requires prospective clinical validation
• Integration Requirements: Must be combined with standard clinical assessment
• Regulatory Status: Research use only, not for diagnostic decisions
• Technical Requirements: Specialized laboratory infrastructure needed

RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS:

1. VALIDATION PHASE:
   • Independent cohort validation
   • Multi-institutional study design
   • Prospective clinical trial integration

2. REGULATORY PREPARATION:
   • FDA/EMA regulatory pathway planning
   • Clinical utility studies
   • Health economic assessments

3. CLINICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
   • Laboratory certification processes
   • Clinical guideline integration
   • Physician training programs

QUALITY ASSURANCE:

• Model Performance Monitoring: Continuous accuracy assessment
• Bias Detection: Regular fairness and equity evaluations
• Technical Validation: Ongoing analytical performance verification
• Clinical Correlation: Regular clinical outcome correlation studies
